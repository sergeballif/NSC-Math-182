# Guided Practice 1.5: Interpreting, estimating, and using the derivative

## Overview

In this section we use the concepts we've developed about the derivative to expand its use and scope. We'll first learn how to find the **units** of any derivative, which will give insight into how the derivative can be used apart from "velocity" problems. Then we will learn the computational techniques of **forward**, **backward**, and **central differences** that will allow us to estimate derivatives numerically in case the original function is not a formula but just a table of data. Finally, the section delves into what the derivative means in terms of real-world contexts. 

## Learning objectives

__Basic objectives__: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks _prior_ to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below). 


* Given a function $y = f(x)$ and the units of measure of both x and y, state the units of $f'(x)$. 
* Estimate the derivative of a function at a point using a forward, backward, and central difference approximation. (See Example 1.4.)

__Advanced objectives__: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student _during_ and _following_ class discussions. 

* Given a function $y = f(x)$ that is given as a table of data, construct a table of approximate values of $f'(x)$ both by hand and using a spreadsheet. 
* Given the values of $f(a)$ and $f'(a)$, estimate the value of $f(b)$ for some point $b$ near $a$.
* Reason mathematically (without computation) about the values and behavior of the derivative, given information about the original function. 
* Interpret the meaning of a derivative value in clear English that makes sense in context.

## Learning resources 

To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following. 

__Textbook__: In _Active Calculus_, read Section 1.5. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go. 

__Video__: Watch the following videos at the MTH 201 YouTube playlist (http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus).

## Activities

The following activity is to be done _during_ and _following_ your reading and viewing of the resources. Go to [student.desmos.com](https://student.desmos.com/?prepopulateCode=R5UB5) and enter the code `R5UB5` along with your name in the format `Last, First`. For example, I would enter my name as `Ballif, Serge`. Complete each part of the activity. Some of these problems will require you to work them out on paper before entering your answer. Practice producing high quality work so that your work is readable and meaningful. You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline. __Remember to use the Piazza discussion board to ask about any questions you have.__
