#Guided Practice Introduction

##Overview

The goal of the first class period is to clearly outline expectations for both the students and the instructor. We will cover the basics of the syllabus and introduce the online homework component of the class. Then we will cover various tools that students should become adept at using. Finally we will review some of the basic pre-calc tools that we are expected to know.

##Learning Objectives
__Basic learning objectives__

__Basic objectives__: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks _prior_ to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below). 

* Make sure that you understand that you are responsible to know all the precalculus and trigonometry material. We will review it a bit during class, but for the most part you will have to make up any gaps in your knowledge outside of class.
* Be able to access the WeBWorK homework through Canvas.  Recognize all the due dates.

__Advanced objectives__: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student _during_ and _following_ class discussions. 

* Download and use some basic apps to your smart device to help you during class. Suggested apps are Wolfram Alpha, Desmos Free Graphing Calculator, and Geogebra.
* Be able to explain specifications grading to an outsider.
* Download the course textbook and know where to find the course logistics from Canvas.
* Obtain a binder in which to keep your WeBWorK Journal.
* Decide what course grade you are shooting for, and make a game plan that will help you stay on track.

## Learning resources 

To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following. 

__Textbook__: Read the entire preface to the textbook. Seriously.

__Video__: No videos are assigned.

## Activities

The following activity is to be done _during_ and _following_ your reading and viewing of the resources. Go to [student.desmos.com](https://student.desmos.com/?prepopulateCode=hts5) and enter the code `hts5` along with your name in the format `Last, First`. For example, I would enter my name as `Ballif, Serge`. Complete each part of the activity. This is the __Getting Started__ assignment. __You will fail the course if you do not complete this assignment by the end of the first week.__ You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.
