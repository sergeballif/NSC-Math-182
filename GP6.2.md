# Guided Practice for 6.2: Numerical Integration

## Overview

In this section we learn how we can we use definite integrals to measure the area between two curves and also how a definite integral can be used to measure the length of a curve?

## Learning objectives

__Basic objectives__: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks _prior_ to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).

- Know the basic formulas for area and circumference of a circle.
- Be able to draw a 3D figure obtained by rotating a curve around an axis.

__Advanced objectives__: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student _during_ and _following_ class discussions.

- Use the washer method to find the volume of a surface of revolution.
- Use the shell method to find the folumne of a surface of revolution.

## Learning resources

To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.

__Textbook__: In _Active Calculus_, read Section 6.2. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go.

__Video__: Watch the following videos.

## Activities

The following activity is to be done _during_ and _following_ your reading and viewing of the resources. Go to [student.desmos.com](https://student.desmos.com/?prepopulateCode=E48TUN) and enter the code `P2AYJ` along with your name in the format `Last, First`. For example, I would enter my name as `Ballif, Serge`. Complete each part of the activity. Some of these problems will require you to work them out on paper before entering your answer. Practice producing high quality work so that your work is readable and meaningful. You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline. __Remember to use the Piazza discussion board to ask about any questions you have.__
