<h2 id="specifications-for-passno-pass-work-on-guided-practice-daily-quizzes-miniprojects-problems-and-webwork-journal">Specifications for Pass/No Pass work on Guided Practice, Daily Quizzes, Miniprojects, Problems, and WeBWorK Journal</h2>

<p>The rules for determining Pass/No Pass work on these three items are very simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>Pass</strong> on Guided Practice is awarded to responses to Guided Practice items in which <strong>a good-faith effort to be right is given on all items, and the submission is given before the deadline</strong>. A <strong>No Pass</strong> is awarded if the submission is turned in after the deadline. A <strong>No Pass</strong> is also awarded if at least one item in the exercise set is blank or does not show evidence of a good-faith effort to be correct, for example if the response is “I don’t know”. Please note that <strong>mathematical correctness is not a factor</strong>; you are free to be wrong about an item as long as you show evidence of trying to be right.</li>
  <li>A <strong>Pass</strong> on a Daily Quiz is awarded if I score your work as at least 4 points out of 5; otherwise the mark is <strong>No Pass</strong>.</li>
  <li>WeBWorK problems are the one item in the course that are graded using points. Typically each problem is worth 1 point, awarded in full if the answer is correct and 0 otherwise. (Some WeBWorK questions that involve multiple items to answer on a single question will allow partial credit.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="specifications-for-work-on-webwork-journal">Specifications for work on WeBWorK Journal</h2>
<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Start each new WeBWorK assignment on a new page.  Have every page of the journal labeled at the top with the date the problems on that page are due.</li>
  <li>Clearly enumerate each problem and provide a brief summary of the problem statement. This restatment of the problem is so that (a) you are certain you’ve read the problem statement carefully, and (b) you have a record of the statement in your work to return to when studying for exams. For example, instead of writing just Problem 3 you should write</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Problem 3. Let $f(x) = 3e^{5x^2}$.  Find an equation for the tangent line at the point where $x = 1$.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Provide sufficient work to demonstrate the full reasoning behind your solution.  The work that leads to an answer is <em>even more important than</em> the final answer itself.  This is important not only for your own understanding, but also for future studying for exams.</li>
  <li>Clearly circle your answer that you input in WeBWorK.  Indicate clearly on your paper if the answer was accepted as correct or not in WeBWorK but putting a checkmark (correct) next to your circled answer.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will collect homework journals from each student in the class at each of the three in-class exams. I will choose four problems at random from your journal and assess each on a 5-point scale:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(5 points) your response is complete, easy to find and follow, and adheres to the expectations listed above.</li>
  <li>(4 points) your response is complete, but the work is difficult to find or follow, or fails to adhere to at least one of the expectations stated above.</li>
  <li>(3 points) your response is complete, but the work is difficult to find or follow, and fails to adhere to more than one of the expectations stated above.</li>
  <li>(0 points) the problem was not completed.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these 4 5-point grades on 4 random problems, you will receive an overall score out of 10 points based on my impression of your WeBWorK journal.  You should interpret that score of 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 as reflecting an A+, A, B, C, D scale.   Thus, your journal will be graded three times during the semester, each time for a grade of 30 points.</p>

<p><strong>A Passing grade will be assigned to WeBWorK Journals that have obtained at least 25 out of 30 points.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Additional Suggestions</strong>  You will be well-served by being organized and timely in keeping your homework journal and submitting WeBWorK assignments.</p>

<p>I encourage you to keep your homework journal in a 3-ring binder, using loose-leaf paper. You should view it as a way to keep yourself organized and on top of the weekly WeBWorK assignments.</p>

<p>I also urge you to begin working on WeBWorK problems soon after they post and to strive to complete them well in advance of the deadline.  This will offer you the chance to ask questions about problems that you struggle with before the problem set closes.</p>

<p>The number one way to be successful in mathematics is to do a lot of problems, and to do them in a way where you strive to achieve deep, personal understanding of how the problems are solved.</p>

<h2 id="specifications-for-work-on-problems-and-miniprojects">Specifications for work on Problems and Miniprojects</h2>

<p>Problems and Miniprojects differ from other work in the class in that they involve written communication, and not just giving answers to problems. Therefore the specifications for work on these items are more complex and focus mainly on writing, communication, and style.</p>

<h3 id="general-rules-for-passing-work-on-problems-and-miniprojects">General rules for Passing work on Problems and Miniprojects</h3>

<p>Attaining a <strong>PASS</strong> grade on one of these items requires that you be aware of the four different kinds of error that can occur when doing significant work in mathematics.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Computational error</strong>. This occurs when a mathematical computation (calculus, algebra, arithmetic, etc.) is incorrectly carried out, either by hand or on a computer. For example: Given the equaton $3x = 9$ and arriving at $x = 2$ is a computational error.</li>
  <li><strong>Logical error</strong>. A logical error occurs when a conclusion is drawn erroneously from a set of information. For example: Given the equation $x^2 = 9$ and concluding that x must be positive is a logical error. In calculus, if you are given the derivative equation $f’(5) = 0$, and then conclude that f must have a local extreme value at $x = 5$, this is a logical error.</li>
  <li><strong>Syntax error</strong>. Syntax errors occur in one of two ways. First, they can occur as errors in English grammar, when the rules for language usage are not followed correctly, especially to the point that they obscure the thought process in the solution or introduce new errors. Second, they can occur as errors in the usage of mathematical notation, especially if the misuse of notation obscures the solution or introduces new errors. For example, in calculus the misuse of the pronoun “it” without clear reference to an antecedent is a particular problem (example: “It is increasing because it is positive”). In mathematical notation, syntax errors can be caused by switching variables mid-solution (for example, solving $3t = 9$ to get $x = 3$ is an error); by misusing function notation, mismatching parentheses, and a host of other possibilities. (Note: WeBWorK in particular has no mercy when it comes to syntax error.)</li>
  <li><strong>Semantic error</strong>. Semantic errors occur when the rules of the <em>grammar</em> of a language are followed but the resulting statements are nonsensical or meaningless. For example, the statement “Colorless green ideas sleep furiously” is correct English syntax but has no meaning, therefore it represents a semantic error. In mathematics, a similarly semantically erroneous statement would be “The following graph can be factored”. This is a semantic error because we don’t “factor” graphs; we factor polynomials and integers, and to say we are “factoring a graph” is meaningless.</li>
</ol>

<p>In reality, these errors are closely linked together, and an error in one category usually introduces an error in one of the others. The general rule for Math 182 is: <strong>Work on Problems and Miniprojects must be almost, if not  entirely free of all of the above kinds of error in order to be assessed at the PASS level; and there can be no significant instances of any of these errors.</strong> That is, a small number of minor errors can be tolerated as long as they do not make the answer incorrect (for Problems) or significantly obscure the thought process in the solution. But large numbers of minor errors, or a single instance of a major error, will result in the problem being marked as <strong>No PASS</strong>.</p>

<p>For these items, we will often refer to the <strong>standard audience for Math 181</strong>, which is defined to be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The standard audience in Math 182 consists of classmates in Math 182 who are familiar with the mathematical ideas discussed in the class and have the appropriate background knowledge for the class, but who are unfamiliar with the particular problem whose solution you are presenting and therefore need to be persuaded that your solution is correct and your conclusions believable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore some items will not need to be discussed in a solution; for example, if a problem involves solving $3x - 4 = 5$ for $x$, you can jump straight to $x = 3$ without showing work. But for example, if a problem is asking you to compute a derivative using the Chain Rule, you will need to show all the calculus steps because the standard audience has not seen your problem. (You could skip the algebra steps needed to simplify the solution, but then you must be 100% assured that your simplified answer is correct.)</p>

<p>In addition to the above, here are some special rules for other aspects of your work on Problems and Miniprojects.</p>

<h3 id="specifications-for-supporting-work">Specifications for supporting work</h3>

<p>In Problems and Miniprojects it is crucial that you <strong>not only give an answer or a conclusion but also clear, complete, and correct work that backs up your answer or conclusion</strong>. Submitted work that consists only of answers will receive a <strong>No PASS</strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For <em>Problems</em> in which you are asked for a clearly-defined answer to a computational problem, the answer must be clearly indicated (for example, by drawing a box around it), and there must be supporting work free of significant gaps for the standard Math 182 audience that clearly supports your answer. Story problems must be answered with a full sentence that includes appropriate units.</li>
  <li>For <em>Miniprojects</em> in which there may not be a single right answer but rather a conclusion or analysis you are asked to perform, the conclusion you are asked to draw or analysis must be clearly indicated (for example, by setting it off in a separate section of your writeup), and there must be supporting work free of significant gaps for the standard Math 182 audience that clearly supports your conclusion. In a miniprojects that asks you to create a teaching lesson, your explanations and presentation should be at the level of the instructor or a competent tutor. The explanations and details should be clear to the standard Math 182 audience.</li>
  <li>Answers or conclusions that are given that have only minimal supporting work, or for which the relationship between the answer/conclusion and the supporting work is tenuous, illogical, or unclear will be marked <strong>No PASS</strong> and returned without further feedback.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="specifications-for-formatting-submissions">Specifications for formatting submissions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Submissions of  Miniprojects must be either typed or neatly handwritten and submitted via Canvas as PDF files. Files that are submitted in some other form besides PDF will be marked as <strong>No PASS</strong> and returned to the author without feedback.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="specifications-for-graphical-elements">Specifications for graphical elements</h3>

<p>The following specifications apply specifically to graphs of functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Graphs must be situated in a viewing window that shows all the important facets of your graph and which does not include excessive “dead space”.</li>
  <li>Both axes of the graph must be clearly labelled with three pieces of information: the <em>quantity being represented</em>, the <em>variable name</em>, and the <em>units</em>. A recommended way to format this information is <code class="highlighter-rouge">Quantity (variable) [units]</code> For example, a graph of a function v(t) that gives velocity v as a function of time t would have the horizontal axis labeled <code class="highlighter-rouge">Time (t) [seconds]</code> and the vertical axis labeled <code class="highlighter-rouge">Velocity (v) [m/sec]</code>.</li>
  <li>Both axes should include tick marks that are sufficiently labeled to show the scaling. Choose scale increments for both axes that are easy to read.</li>
  <li>If you are graphing more than one function on the same set of axes, each individual function must be clearly labeled.</li>
</ul>

<p>Graphs that are included in a writeup for a Problem or Miniproject <em>must</em> satisfy all of these stylistic elements in order to be marked as <strong>PASS</strong> unless the context of the problem prohibits one or more of these elements being met. For example, if you are asked to draw a graph of a function but the function does not correspond to any real-world relationship and does not have units, then obviously your axis labels do not need to include the quantity or the units. (But they <em>should</em> include the correct variable name.)</p>
