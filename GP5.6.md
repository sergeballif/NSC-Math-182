# Guided Practice for 5.6: Numerical Integration

## Overview

How do we accurately evaluate a definite integral when we cannot use the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus because the integrand lacks an elementary algebraic antiderivative? Are there ways to generate accurate estimates without using extremely large values of $n$ in Riemann sums?

What is the Trapezoid Rule, and how is it related to left, right, and middle Riemann sums?

How are the errors in the Trapezoid Rule and Midpoint Rule related, and how can they be used to develop an even more accurate rule?

## Learning objectives

__Basic objectives__: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks _prior_ to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).

- Know how to compute left, right, and midpoint Riemann sums.
- Know the relationship between a Riemann sum and a definite integral.

__Advanced objectives__: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student _during_ and _following_ class discussions.

- Estimate the value of a definite integral using the trapezoid rule.
- Estimate the value of a definite integral using the Simpson's rule.
- Be able to estimate whether a specific integral estimate is an over- or under-estimate.

## Learning resources

To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.

__Textbook__: In _Active Calculus_, read Section 5.6. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go.

__Video__: Watch the following videos.

- [Estimating with Left, right and midpoints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QC7mmsHcUxA&list=PL9bIjQJDwfGtewW75Nw7PnGNSkfqwAm3v&index=25) (9:19)
- [The Trapezoid Rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njd6Rb7u2xA&list=PL9bIjQJDwfGtewW75Nw7PnGNSkfqwAm3v&index=26) (8:22)
- [Simpson's Rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_LeBsaGaiw&list=PL9bIjQJDwfGtewW75Nw7PnGNSkfqwAm3v&index=27) (6:40)

## Activities

The following activity is to be done _during_ and _following_ your reading and viewing of the resources. Go to [student.desmos.com](https://student.desmos.com/?prepopulateCode=7TZ9WB) and enter the code `DDTJS` along with your name in the format `Last, First`. For example, I would enter my name as `Ballif, Serge`. Complete each part of the activity. Some of these problems will require you to work them out on paper before entering your answer. Practice producing high quality work so that your work is readable and meaningful. You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline. __Remember to use the Piazza discussion board to ask about any questions you have.__
