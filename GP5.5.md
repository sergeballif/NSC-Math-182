# Guided Practice for 5.5: Other Integration Methods

## Overview

We can evaluate an integral involving a rational function by decomposing the rational function into a sum of fractions in a simpler form. We can use more advanced substitutions to evaluate other integers. Sometimes we will resort to using a table of integrals to evaluate an integral.


## Learning objectives

__Basic objectives__: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks _prior_ to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).

- Be comfortable with the methods of $u$-substitution and integration by parts.
- Add and subtract rational functions. Simplify algebraic expressions.

__Advanced objectives__: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student _during_ and _following_ class discussions.

- Use a partial fraction decomposition to simply an expression into terms you can integrate.
- Use an integral table to evaluate tricky integrals.
- Be familiar with Wolfram Alpha or other online integral calculators.

## Learning resources

To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.

__Textbook__: In _Active Calculus_, read Section 5.5. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go.

__Video__: Watch the following videos.

- [Constructing Partial Fraction Decomposition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KL9pAets0Rg&index=24&list=PL9bIjQJDwfGtewW75Nw7PnGNSkfqwAm3v&t=39s) (9:13)

## Activities

Complete the Guided Practice assignment in Canvas _during_ and _following_ your reading and viewing of the resources.

<!--
The following activity is to be done _during_ and _following_ your reading and viewing of the resources. Go to [student.desmos.com](https://student.desmos.com/?prepopulateCode=WD2C7M) and enter the code `wqrpq` along with your name in the format `Last, First`. For example, I would enter my name as `Ballif, Serge`. Complete each part of the activity. Some of these problems will require you to work them out on paper before entering your answer. Practice producing high quality work so that your work is readable and meaningful. You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline. __Remember to use the Piazza discussion board to ask about any questions you have.__
