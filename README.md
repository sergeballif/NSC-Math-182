# NSC-Math-181
Guided Practice Assignments for Calculus 1

This is the home to the webpages and other class resources for Math 181 at Nevada State College. Most of this work has been modified by Serge Ballif from the original work of [Robert Talbert](http://rtalbert.org) at GVSU at https://github.com/RobertTalbert/calculus. The course is taught using an inverted or flipped class design. Under this design: 

+ Students work prior to class, through structured preparatory activities called Guided Practice, to attain fluency on a set of basic Learning Objectives. 
+ During class, students work actively with the instructor's direct assistance on challenging problems on deeper, more advanced learning objectives. 

The course also uses specifications grading, which is described [here](http://www.utimes.pitt.edu/?p=30598). 

The materials in this repo correspond to the chapters and sections in the textbook [Active Calculus](http://faculty.gvsu.edu/boelkinm/Home/Download.html) by Matt Boelkins, a free and open source calculus text. 

Over 9 hours of video screencasts were created by Grand Valley State University to go along with the textbook. The videos for the course and are housed [at the GVSU Mathematics Department YouTube channel](http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus).
