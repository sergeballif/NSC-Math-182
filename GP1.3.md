# Guided Practice 1.3:	The Derivative of a Function at a Point

## Overview

In this section we make first contact with the most central concept in the course: The notion of the **derivative of a function**. The derivative of a function at a point is essentially the same thing as the instantaneous velocity of an object at a single point in time, but the derivative is more general and encompasses a much wider range of applications than just motion. In the section, we define the derivative of a function at a point in terms of average rates of change and limits; introduce the **"prime" notation** for the derivative; discuss the units of measurement for the derivative; and connect the derivative to the geometric concept of a tangent line and especially its slope.

## Learning objectives

__Basic objectives__: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks _prior_ to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below). 

* Calculate the average rate of change in a function on an interval. 
* State the limit-based definition of the derivative of a function at a point (Definition 1.3). 
* Use correct notation to indicate the derivative of a function at a point and explain the difference between the quantities \\(f(a)\\) and \\(f'(a)\\). 
* State what it means for a function to be differentiable at a point. 
* Given the units of a function f and the units of an input \\(a\\), state the units of the derivative \\(f'(a)\\). 
* Describe the derivative in terms of the slope of a tangent line. 

__Advanced objectives__: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student _during_ and _following_ class discussions. 

* Calculate a derivative of a polynomial function \\(f\\) at a point \\(x = a\\) using the definition (see Example 1.3). 
* Use the definition of the derivative to find the instantaneous rate of change in a function at a particular point. 
* Interpret the results of a derivative calculation in everyday terms, using correct units and clear explanations.

## Learning resources 

To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following. 

__Textbook__: In _Active Calculus_, read Section 1.3. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go. 

__Video__: Watch the following videos at the MTH 201 YouTube playlist (http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus).

## Activities

The following activity is to be done _during_ and _following_ your reading and viewing of the resources. Go to [student.desmos.com](https://student.desmos.com/?prepopulateCode=DBNSQ) and enter the code `DBNSQ` along with your name in the format `Last, First`. For example, I would enter my name as `Ballif, Serge`. Complete each part of the activity. Some of these problems will require you to work them out on paper before entering your answer. Practice producing high quality work so that your work is readable and meaningful. You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline. __Remember to use the Piazza discussion board to ask about any questions you have.__
