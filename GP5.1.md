# Guided Practice for 5.1: Constructing accurate graphs of antiderivatives

## Overview

In this section we learn how to determine what the graph $y=f(x)$ looks like when we know the graph of $y=f'(x)$. In particular we  can get a unique graph when we know a single point $(a,f(a))$ if $f$ is a continuous function. The ideas of this section complement the techniques we learned back in Chapter 1 about plotting the derivative of a function.


## Learning objectives

__Basic objectives__: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks _prior_ to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below). 

- Know the statement and meaning of the Total Change Theorem.
- Describe in words the meaning of the function $A(x)=\int_a^x f(t)\,dt$. Know why this function is called ``the net-signed area from $a$ up to $x$'' function.

__Advanced objectives__: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student _during_ and _following_ class discussions. 

- Be able to sketch a graph of a function $y=F(x)$ when given the graph of $y=F'(x)$.
- Be able to evaluate a function $A(x)=\int_a^x f(t)\,dt$ for specific values of $x$.


## Learning resources 

To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following. 

__Textbook__: In _Active Calculus_, read Section 5.1. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go. 

__Video__: Watch the following videos.

## Activities

The following activity is to be done _during_ and _following_ your reading and viewing of the resources. Go to [student.desmos.com](https://student.desmos.com/?prepopulateCode=9PXTS) and enter the code `9PXTS` along with your name in the format `Last, First`. For example, I would enter my name as `Ballif, Serge`. Complete each part of the activity. Some of these problems will require you to work them out on paper before entering your answer. Practice producing high quality work so that your work is readable and meaningful. You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline. __Remember to use the Piazza discussion board to ask about any questions you have.__
