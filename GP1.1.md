# Guided Practice 1.1: How do we measure velocity?

## Overview 

Our study of calculus begins with a basic building block for understanding change: the concept of **average velocity**. Two formulas for average velocity are introduced in the section and connected to the concept of the slope of a line. The concept of **instantaneous velocity** -- central to an understanding of calculus -- is introduced at the end. 

## Learning objectives

__Basic objectives__: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks _prior_ to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below). 

* Given a formula for the position of an object as a function of time, find the object's position at a specific time. 
* Calculate the average velocity of an object over a given time interval using the average velocity formula on page 2. 
* Calculate the average velocity of an object over a given time interval using the average velocity formula on page 5.
* Explain the differences between the two average velocity formulas in this section. 
* Explain the difference between average velocity and instantaneous velocity. 

__Advanced objectives__: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student _during_ and _following_ class discussions. 

* Explain the meaning of a negative velocity. 
* Interpret the average velocity of an object geometrically through the use of the graph of its position function. 
* Use the second average velocity formula to find the average velocity of an object on an interval starting at time $t = a$ and ending at time $t = a + h$, where $a$ is given but $h$ is a variable. Express the answer in simplest form as a function of $h$. 
* Given the average velocity of an object from time $t = a$ to time $t = a+h$, find its instantaneous velocity at the single moment $t = a$. (See Example 1.1 and Screencast 1.1.3.)

## Learning resources 

To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following. 

__Textbook__: In _Active Calculus_, read Section 1.1 pages 1--7. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go. 

__Video__: Watch the following videos at the MTH 201 YouTube playlist (http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus).

## Activities

The following activity is to be done _during_ and _following_ your reading and viewing of the resources. Go to [student.desmos.com](https://student.desmos.com/?prepopulateCode=vwesv) and enter the code `vwesv` along with your name in the format `Last, First`. For example, I would enter my name as `Ballif, Serge`. Complete each part of the activity. Some of these problems will require you to work them out on paper before entering your answer. Practice producing high quality work so that your work is readable and meaningful. You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.
